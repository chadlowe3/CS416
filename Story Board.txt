Intro - Moore's Law

Moore's Law is the observation that the transistor counts in an integrated circuit double roughly every two years.

Moore's law isn't a natural law; it's a goal set by the semiconductor industry to drive the design
and manufacturing of integrated circuits. This law has remarkably held true for over 50 years.

Chart 1 - Overview of transistor counts in CPU's

Here you see a plot of CPU transistor count over 50 years from 1971 to 2021. Doubling the transistor
count every 2 years means that the transistor count in CPU's increases exponentially over time. By plotting
this exponential increase on a logarithmic scale the line is straight, switching to a linear scale demonstrates
the exponential increase better.



Chart 2 - Moore's Law

What would Moores Law have predicted? When we add Moore's Law to the chart, it can be seen that
transitor count tracked almost perfectly for 5 decades.




Chart 3 - CPU Process Size

We said that Moore's Law wasn't a natrual law, but a goal for the manufacturing industry. In order to meet
that goal, scientists have systematically reduced the size of the transistors that make up the CPU's. Measured
first in micrometers, then nanometers. Smaller transistors mean more transistors can be packaged on a die.
Here you see how transistor size has decreased over the years, allowing for Moore's Law to maintained.
